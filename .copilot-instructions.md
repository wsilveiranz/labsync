# LabSync - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
**LabSync** is a lightweight lab resource booking web application focused on preventing double-bookings and improving resource visibility. The project prioritizes rapid prototyping with a clear path to production enhancement.

**Tagline:** "Smart Scheduling for Smarter Science"

## Development Philosophy
- **Speed over perfection**: Build working prototypes quickly (30-60 minutes)
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start client-side, add backend when needed
- **Minimal dependencies**: Vanilla JavaScript preferred over frameworks
- **User-centric**: Focus on core booking workflow first

## Target Users
- **Lab members**: Need quick, conflict-free equipment booking
- **Lab managers**: Require visibility into resource usage and scheduling
- **Primary use case**: In-lab desktop usage with simple, intuitive interface

## Technical Architecture

### Phase 1: Rapid Prototype (Current Focus)
- **Single HTML file** with embedded CSS/JS
- **localStorage persistence** (no server required)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks)
- **Hardcoded resources** for immediate functionality
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (GitHub Pages, local file)

### Phase 2: Production Enhancement (Future)
- **Python Flask backend** with JSON file storage
- **Azure App Service** deployment
- **Multi-user support** with basic authentication
- **Data migration** from localStorage to backend

## Core Features (Priority Order)

### Must Have (30 min implementation)
1. **Resource dropdown** (5 lab resources: 2 microscopes, cold room, centrifuge, PCR machine)
2. **Booking form** (name, resource, date, start time, duration)
3. **Conflict detection** (prevent overlapping bookings)
4. **localStorage persistence** (data survives refresh)
5. **Booking list** (view all current bookings)

### Nice to Have (15-30 min extra)
6. **Delete bookings** (remove button for each booking)
7. **Visual feedback** (success/error messages)
8. **Form validation** (prevent past dates, required fields)
9. **Today's schedule** (quick view of current day)

## Data Structure
```javascript
// localStorage key: 'labsync_bookings'
// Booking object format:
{
  id: "uuid-string",
  name: "John Doe",
  resource: "Microscope A", 
  date: "2025-09-15",
  startTime: "09:00",
  duration: 120, // minutes
  timestamp: 1694764800000
}

// Resources (hardcoded):
const RESOURCES = [
  { id: "microscope-a", name: "Microscope A", type: "equipment" },
  { id: "microscope-b", name: "Microscope B", type: "equipment" },
  { id: "cold-room-1", name: "Cold Room 1", type: "room" },
  { id: "centrifuge", name: "Centrifuge", type: "equipment" },
  { id: "pcr-machine", name: "PCR Machine", type: "equipment" }
];
```

## Key Functions to Implement
```javascript
function checkConflict(resource, date, startTime, duration) // → boolean
function saveBooking(bookingData) // → {success: boolean, message: string}
function getBookings(filterBy = {}) // → array of bookings
function deleteBooking(id) // → boolean
```

## Brand & Styling Guidelines

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Crimson Red `#B91C1C` (buttons, headers, key actions)
- **Secondary**: Warm Coral `#F87171` (hover states, secondary elements)  
- **Accent**: Golden Amber `#F59E0B` (highlights, success states)
- **Background**: Off-White `#F9FAFB` (page background)
- **Text**: Charcoal `#111827` (high contrast, WCAG compliant)

### Design Principles
- **Minimalist and modern** with clean lines
- **Rounded corners** and subtle shadows
- **Bold sans-serif typography** for headings
- **Plenty of white space** for clean layout
- **Mobile-friendly** but desktop-first

## Coding Preferences

### HTML
- Semantic HTML5 elements
- Accessible form labels and ARIA attributes
- Single file approach for prototype phase

### CSS
- CSS custom properties for color variables
- Flexbox/Grid for layout
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Utility-first approach (similar to Tailwind patterns)

### JavaScript
- ES6+ modern syntax
- Functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Clear, descriptive function names
- Error handling for user actions
- localStorage management with JSON parsing

## Validation Requirements
- **Conflict prevention**: Zero double-bookings possible
- **Data persistence**: Survives browser refresh
- **Form validation**: Reject invalid inputs (past dates, empty fields)
- **User feedback**: Clear success/error messages
- **Performance**: Complete booking flow in <10 clicks

## Future Stretch Goals (Don't implement now)
- Calendar view with drag-and-drop
- Usage analytics dashboard
- Email notifications
- Multi-lab support
- QR code equipment tracking
- Integration with lab access systems
- Recurring bookings
- Mobile app

## Common Patterns to Suggest
- localStorage wrapper functions for data persistence
- Conflict detection using time interval overlap logic
- Form validation with immediate visual feedback
- Simple UUID generation for booking IDs
- Date/time formatting for user display
- Responsive grid layouts for booking lists

## Testing Approach
- Manual testing with edge cases (overlapping times, past dates)
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- localStorage persistence verification
- Form validation testing
- Conflict detection verification

## Deployment Notes
- Phase 1: Single HTML file (works anywhere)
- Phase 2: Azure App Service with Python Flask
- Use relative paths for any assets
- Ensure CORS compatibility for future API integration
